# Javascript-Effects

My second, non-tutorial project.

With this project, my goal is to demonstrate a small amount of what JavaScript has to offer -- wrapped in a simple, minimalistic interface that users can navigate easily.


If you happen to encounter any bugs, or simply just have questions, comments, or concerns, please feel free to reach out!




Thank you for your time.
